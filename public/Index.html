    <p>The roseate spoonbill is sometimes placed in its own genus - Ajaia. A 2010 study of mitochondrial DNA of the
        spoonbills by Chesser and colleagues found that the roseate and yellow-billed spoonbills were each other's
        closest relatives, and the two were descended from an early offshoot from the ancestors of the other four
        spoonbill species. They felt the genetic evidence meant it was equally valid to consider all six to be
        classified within the genus Platalea or alternatively the two placed in the monotypic genera Platibis and Ajaia,
        respectively. However, as the six species were so similar morphologically, keeping them within the one genus
        made more sense.</p>

    <h2>Intresting facts about <b>roseate spoonbill</b></h2>
    <pre>
    The Roseate Spoonbill is 1 of 6 species of spoonbills in the world and the only one 
    found in the Americas. The other 5 spoonbills (Eurasian, Royal, African, Black-faced, 
    and Yellow-billed) occur in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia.
            
    As humans, we are all too familiar with hair loss as we get older. Roseate Spoonbills, 
    it turns out, are familiar with balding too, but instead of losing hair they lose 
    feathers from the top of their head as they get older.

    Roseate Spoonbill chicks don't have a spoon-shaped bill immediately after hatching. When 
    they are 9 days old the bill starts to flatten, by 16 days it starts to look a bit more 
    spoonlike, and by 39 days it is nearly full size.

    Roseate Spoonbills get their pink coloration from the foods they eat. Crustaceans and 
    other aquatic invertebrates contain pigments called carotenoids that help turn their 
    feathers pink.
